# Vulkan Workshop, Part 5 "Descriptors and Textures"

This branch contains the code for the initial state of the workshop's part 5.     
Please checkout this branch in order to work on the tasks of part 5.    
The branch of part 6 will contain the solutions.

**Preparations** 
* Make sure to have read the `README.md` file in the [`master`](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop) branch
* It is highly recommended to watch the [Introduction to Vulkan](https://youtu.be/ZWV6zvKe9Hc) lecture 
* Read further documentation and instructions directly in the source code
* You'll find a lot of helpful information in the [Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html), especially relevant for this part: [13. Resource Descriptors](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#descriptorsets)

**Tasks**
* Watch out for **`// TODO Part 5` comments** in code! All tasks are described using these.
* Fix real/potential animation stuttering by properly handling resources for concurrent frames once again
* Create a texture in device memory that can be sampled in shaders
* Create a "combined image sampler"-type descriptor for the texture

**Navigation**
* Back to [master](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop)
* Previous part: [Part 4](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop/tree/part4)
* Next part: Part 6 TBD
