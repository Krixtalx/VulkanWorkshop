# Vulkan Workshop, Part 4 "Renderpass and Graphics Pipeline"

This branch contains the code for the initial state of the workshop's part 4.     
Please checkout this branch in order to work on the tasks of part 4.    
The branch of part 5 will contain the solutions.

**Preparations** 
* Make sure to have read the `README.md` file in the [`master`](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop) branch
* It is highly recommended to watch the [Introduction to Vulkan](https://youtu.be/ZWV6zvKe9Hc) lecture 
* Read further documentation and instructions directly in the source code
* You'll find a lot of helpful information in the [Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html), especially relevant for this part: [7.4. Render Pass Commands](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#renderpass-commands)

**Tasks**
* Watch out for **`// TODO Part 4` comments** in code! All tasks are described using these.
* Configure proper load and store operations, and layouts for framebuffer attachments in a renderpass
* Configure proper synchronization dependencies for a renderpass
* Use graphics pipeline and renderpass to draw a 3D model

**Navigation**
* Back to [master](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop)
* Previous part: [Part 3](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop/tree/part3)
* Next part: [Part 5](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop/tree/part5)
