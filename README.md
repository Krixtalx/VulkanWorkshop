# Vulkan Workshop, Part 6 "Reflect on it"

This branch contains the code for the initial state of the workshop's part 6.     
Please checkout this branch in order to work on the tasks of part 6.    

This is the final part of this workshop. If you have made it this far: **Congratulations!**    
There are no solutions to the tasks of this part yet. They will be provided at an indeterminate time in the distant future.

**Preparations** 
* Make sure to have read the `README.md` file in the [`master`](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop) branch
* It is highly recommended to watch the [Introduction to Vulkan](https://youtu.be/ZWV6zvKe9Hc) lecture 
* Read further documentation and instructions directly in the source code
* You'll find a lot of helpful information in the [Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html)

**Tasks**
* Watch out for **`// TODO Part 6` comments** in code! All tasks are described using these.
* Implement reflections in the fragment shader! Also reflect on the current application structure: Which changes do you have to make in order to enable that?
* There is an optional/bonus task about the 300 prepared command buffers from [Part 2](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop/tree/part2)

**Navigation**
* Back to [master](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop)
* Previous part: [Part 5](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/VulkanWorkshop/tree/part5)
* Final part: Solutions to Part 6 (When it's done.)
